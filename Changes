Revision history for DBIx::Class::Sims (ordered by revision number).

0.20 Dec 25 2013 20:00:00 PDT
   - THIS RELEASE CONTAINS A BREAKING API CHANGE.
   - All of these changes are due bug reports from moltar on github.
   - You can now specify the values of the primary key. (Issue #1)
   - The second and third options to load_sims() have been merged into a single
     second option of "options".
     - The constraints parameter is now $options->{constraints}
     - The hooks parameter is now $options->{hooks}
   - There is now a new $options->{toposort} which allows passing options to the
     underlying TopoSort implementation. This is primarily useful for self-
     referential tables.

   - THIS RELEASE CONTAINS A BREAKING API CHANGE.
   - The return value from load_sims() now contains the whole $row object, not
     just a hashref of the primary keys.
   - You can now pass in things other than an array of hashes for a resultsource
     in the sim specification.
       - A number, if all you're willing to accept the defaults and sims.
       - A hashref, if you just want one thing.
       - An arrayref (this was the previous API)
       - If you pass in anything else, that resultsource will be skipped.
   - You can now pass in a sim entry instead of a value for a given column.

   - Fixed a bug where specifying an auto-generated parent's columns didn't
     actually set the values on the parent.

   - Better documentation of the "sim" entry in the column_info
   - Added nullable frequency.
      - This allows control over when a nullable column is null vs. populated.

      - ip_address

0.04 Sep 20 2013 14:30:00 PDT
   - Split out the included types documentation into its own POD
   - Added "value" as an sim option.
      - This behaves like default_value without requiring a default_value on
        the column.
   - Added the following column types:
      - us_firstname
      - us_lastname
      - email_address
   - us_name uses us_firstname and us_lastname, plus sometimes provides a middle
     initial.
